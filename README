PRELUDE OF THE CHAMBERED

This is a modified version of Notch's 48 hour "Ludum Dare" game competition entry.
The code has been changed to use 64 x 64 textures instead of 16 x 16. The engine
seems to be running fast enough to support the resolution increase.

While the graphics do not look significantly better than the original version, the
texture files allow for much finer detail.

I shall be adding better textures in subsequent commits.
